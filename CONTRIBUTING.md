## Code of Conduct

This project is governed by a simple principle: **be respectful and constructive**. Harassment, trolling, and other unprofessional behavior will not be tolerated.

## Getting Help

If you have a question about using sqlfmt, open a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/reepolee/sqlfmt/discussions) rather than an issue.

## Reporting Bugs

Before reporting a bug, please:

1. Check the [existing issues](https://github.com/reepolee/sqlfmt/issues) to see if it has already been reported.
2. Try to reproduce the bug with the latest version.
3. Include a minimal SQL example that triggers the bug — both the input and the unexpected output.

When opening a bug report, include:

- Your OS and Rust version (`rustc --version`)
- The version of sqlfmt (if installed)
- The exact SQL input that causes the issue
- What you expected the formatted output to look like
- What the actual formatted output looks like

## Suggesting Features

Feature requests are welcome! When suggesting a feature:

- Explain the use case and why it would be useful
- If the feature relates to SQL formatting, provide examples of input and desired output
- Indicate if you'd be willing to help implement it

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (edition 2021, latest stable)

### Getting Started

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sqlfmt.git
cd sqlfmt

# Build the project
cargo build

# Run tests
cargo test

# Run the binary
echo "SELECT * FROM users;" | cargo run
```

## Making Changes

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Create a branch for your changes (`git checkout -b my-feature`).
3. Make your changes, keeping commits small and focused.
4. Write or update tests to cover your changes.
5. Run the full test suite (`cargo test`).
6. Push your branch and open a pull request.

## Code Style

- Follow standard Rust formatting. Run `cargo fmt` before committing.
- Address all `cargo clippy` warnings.
- Keep functions focused and small. If a function is growing too long, consider splitting it.
- Use descriptive names for variables and functions.
- Add comments for non-obvious logic, but prefer self-documenting code.
- When adding a new SQL statement type, follow the existing pattern in the codebase:
  - Add a detection clause in the statement classifier
  - Create a dedicated formatter function or module
  - Add tests for various edge cases
  - Update the README's Supported statement types list

## Testing

### Running tests

```bash
# Run the full test suite
cargo test
```

### Golden file tests

The project uses golden file (snapshot) integration tests. Each test case consists of a pair of files in [`tests/data/`](tests/data):

- **`<name>.input.sql`** — the raw SQL input to format
- **`<name>.golden.sql`** — the expected formatted output

The test binary pipes the input through `sqlfmt` via stdin and asserts that stdout matches the golden file exactly.

### Adding a new test case

1. Create `<name>.input.sql` and `<name>.golden.sql` in `tests/data/`
2. To generate the golden file, run:
   ```bash
   cat tests/data/<name>.input.sql | cargo run > tests/data/<name>.golden.sql
   ```
3. Add a test function in [`tests/integration_test.rs`](tests/integration_test.rs):
   ```rust
   #[test]
   fn test_<name>() {
       run_golden_test("<name>");
   }
   ```
4. Run `cargo test` to verify

### What to cover

When adding features or fixing bugs, include test cases that cover:

- Normal/expected inputs
- Edge cases (empty input, missing semicolon)
- Comment preservation (`--`, `/* */`, `#`)
- Comparison operators (`>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `!=`, `<>`)
- Subqueries (`(SELECT ...)` in column lists and WHERE clauses)
- Statement-specific formatting (UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE TABLE, INSERT, CREATE VIEW)
- Multiple statements (same type and mixed types)

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure all tests pass and there are no `cargo clippy` warnings.
2. Update the README if your changes add, remove, or change any user-facing behavior (e.g., new statement type support, flags, etc.).
3. Reference any related issues in your PR description (e.g., "Closes #12").
4. A maintainer will review your PR. Address any feedback with additional commits.

## Release Checklist

Each build machine runs its own release script after code changes are pushed. The first machine to run bumps the version, creates the GitHub Release tag, and uploads its binary. Subsequent machines detect the existing release and upload their platform's binary.

### Workflow (run on each machine after pushing code)

1. **macOS (first):** `bash release.sh` — bumps version (patch), creates tag + GitHub Release, uploads macOS binary
2. **Linux:** `bash release.sh` — builds and uploads Linux binary to the existing release
3. **Windows:** `.\release.ps1` — builds and uploads Windows binary to the existing release

### Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--draft` / `-Draft` | Create the release as a draft (default: published) |
| `--minor` / `-Minor` | Bump the minor version instead of patch (default: patch) |
| `--force` / `-Force` | Skip version mismatch check (use when pushing ahead of remote) |

### Prerequisites

- [gh CLI](https://cli.github.com/) — authenticated via `gh auth login`
- git
- Rust toolchain

The `release.sh` script automatically runs `cargo test` before building, so you don't need to do it manually.

### Cross-compilation prerequisites

For releases on **macOS**, install the cross-compilation toolchain first:

```bash
rustup target add x86_64-apple-darwin x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
brew tap messense/macos-cross-toolchains
brew install x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

### Binary naming convention

Platform-annotated binaries produced by the build scripts:

| Binary | Platform |
|--------|----------|
| `sqlfmt-macos-arm64` | Apple Silicon Mac |
| `sqlfmt-macos-x64` | Intel Mac |
| `sqlfmt-macos-universal` | Universal Mac (arm64 + x64) |
| `sqlfmt-linux-x64` | Linux x86_64 |
| `sqlfmt-windows-x64.exe` | Windows x86_64 |

The install scripts (`install.sh`, `install.ps1`) auto-detect the platform and install the correct binary.
